Simply the best! Ordered dinner takeout last evening and I am still smiling with how delicious the food was. Finally a restaurant that is worth going to and worth waiting for the food to be prepared. Looking forward to returning for a proper eat in experience.	1
You can play ludo there. The food is great, the service is okay but the people are really nice.	1
I’d recommend the hujra special karahi. It was the best.	1
Best place to come to if you are looking for quality food and affordable prices. Karahi is a must try. Will definitely come again.	1
The food is decent at best but the quantity is insanely low for the absurdly high price point. With the other great reviews, I'm not sure if its because I went on a weekday but they shouldn't be making basic errors like not adding salt to the food.	0
Excellent food that is always fresh. It might take some time, but food is very well flavored and tastes great. Prices are very reasonable as well.	1
I wanted to explore a new restaurant in the area and I came across this restaurant. I would recommend this place. I had the Chicken Biryani and Beef Haleem and it was really good. I am really glad that a restaurant like this came to the area. I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant without a doubt. The owner was humble and really nice.	1
Loved the food!!! Food is so fresh and full of flavor best Karahi I've had. Staff is wonderful.	1
Amazing experience. Loved it. Definitely another book for good food plus the ludo. Lol	1

I finally tried this restaurant today after alot of reccomendations from my friends. I will definitely come back again. Best desi restaurant in the area	1
Went here twice like their haleem naan and karahi. Also had their paneer makhni, gol gappay, kebab, tikka, and kebab platter did not enjoy eating any. Small portion and a bit high on price.	0
I loved the ludo tables in the restaurant. We played ludo while we were waiting for the food. Food was great too, I would recommend their “Hujra Special Karahi”.	1
Had a great experience friendly staff and best karahi in nyc must try out this place.	1
A must try for anyone seeking authentic Pakistani cuisine. Fresh food with pure flavor - The Achari Goat Karahi was cooked to perfection with a great blend of flavor and spice. 5 stars!	1
Karahi is really good, but have not had better karak chai in all of New York area. Place is small and family run, with the youngsters running front desk. Wait can be longer than expected sometimes	1
